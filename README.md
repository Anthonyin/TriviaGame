TODO:
Create a GitHub repo called `TriviaGame`, then clone the repo to your computer.

2.  Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
3.  Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

4.  Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
5.  Inside `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`

    - In your `css` folder, create a `style.css` file.
    - In your `javascript` folder, create an `app.js` file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
    - In your `images` folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

- You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

- The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

  - The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

- Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

- Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
